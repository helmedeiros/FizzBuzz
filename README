= fizz-buzz

== Why?

In coding dojos, I'm sometimes asked to code my solution to the FizzBuzz problem, as the first Kata of day.  
Its a simple challenging question:

  "Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100. When it's multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both print “FizzBuzz”."

With that in mind, I wrote down this solution, think on:

* TDD
* putting it on the githubs
